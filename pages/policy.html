                    Cookies:</strong><br><br>10.1 Salt’n Pepper may set and access cookies on your computer. Cookies
                that may be placed on your computer are detailed in Schedule 1 to this Policy.<br><br>10.2 A Cookie is a
                small file that resides on your computer’s hard drive and often contains an anonymous unique identifier
                and is accessible only by the website that placed it there, not any other sites.<br><br>10.3 You may

                browser will accept Cookies, however, this can be altered. For further details please consult the help
                menu in your browser. Disabling Cookies may prevent you from using the full range of Services available
                on the Web Site.<br><br><br><strong>11. How to control the use of cookies:</strong><br><br>11.1 You are
                not obliged to accept cookies and may modify your browser so that it will not accept cookies. The
                browser you use to surf the web not only allows you to see the cookies that you have got but also allows
                you to control their use. You can control them by allowing them, deleting them individually or deleting
                all of them. You can also set your browser to not accept cookies altogether. If this option is selected,
                you should be aware that many websites will not function properly or at all. It may be possible to set
                your browser to not accept cookies and ask for your consent before each cookie is set on your device.
                This gives you control over what is set on your device, however, has the drawback of slowing down your
                browsing experience. There are different levels of control too. You are able to prevent just third party
                cookies from being deployed, effectively opting out of behavioral advertising, and some even allow you
                to block specific companies you do not wish to deploy a cookie, instead of selecting all companies. In
                order to manage your cookies, please select your browser from the list below and follow the
                instructions:</p>
